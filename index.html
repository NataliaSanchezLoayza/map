        <h1>  CURBSIDE COMPOSTING IS BACK IN NYC, BUT ONLY IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS THAT DIDN’T NEED IT THE MOST  </h1>

          Curbside composting, a free service provided by the NYC Department of Sanitation, resumed in early October this year after it was suspended citywide due to budget cuts during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the DSNY’s official <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dsny/site/services/food-scraps-and-yard-waste-page/bydistrict-curbsidecomposting">website</a>, the service has been restored in only seven eligible community districts. None of them are part of the neighborhoods that lack enough access to composting services.    
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The DSNY provides mainly two composting options to New Yorkers: <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dsny/site/services/food-scraps-and-yard-waste-page/overview-residents-organics">curbside</a> composting, and food scraps and yard waste <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dsny/site/services/food-scraps-and-yard-waste-page/nyc-food-scrap-drop-off-locations">drop-off</a> sites. The drop-off system was the first to be implemented and dates back almost three decades. Residents can dispose of their organic waste in the green bins located at different community centers and gardens, parks, and markets throughout the city. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Currently, there are 152 drop-off sites in NYC. An analysis of the data from November this year indicates that some community districts are disproportionately receiving less access to the service.

        The same data shows that Manhattan has both the most drop-off sites and, on average, the highest rate of drop-off sites per capita, while Brooklyn, which has the second-highest number of drop-off sites, is in third place of drop-off sites per capita.

        The analysis also points out that Community Districts 503 in Staten Island and 205 in the Bronk don’t have a single drop-off site, while Manhattan Community Districts 101 and 104 have the highest rates of drop-off sites per capita. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Compared to the drop-off sites, curbside composting can be the most convenient way of composting for many neighbors. While the drop-off service is usually located at community gardens or farmers’ markets, curbside composting consists of brown plastic containers distributed by the DSNY that residents can conveniently place in front of their houses or buildings. Also, residents can use the bins to dispose of more organic waste than the drop-off sites are allowed to collect, for example, all food waste without exceptions.  
      </p>

      <p>
        Curbside composting started in 2015, many years after the drop-off service did. In May 2020, curbside comporting was suspended citywide due to budget cuts during the COVID-19 pandemic. But when the service resumed this year, it only did in 44 eligible neighborhoods, leaving 15 out of the program.

        “If you are in an eligible neighborhood, we will notify you when service will start in your area. If you do not live in an area where the service is yet offered, we will let you know about opportunities to bring your food scraps to a drop-off location or hot to compost at home,” says the DSNY’s official <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dsny/site/services/food-scraps-and-yard-waste-page/overview-residents-organics">website</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Residents who live in any of the 15 community districts that aren’t yet eligible for the service –in other words, community districts that have never had access to curbside composting– are also encouraged to fill out a form or call 311 to express their interest. “We want to hear from everyone interested in Curbside Composting as it helps us make the case to expand this service to more neighborhoods,” says the DSNY.
      </p>

      <p>
        So far, curbside composting has been restored in only seven eligible community districts: CDs 301, 302, 306, and 307 in Brooklyn; 208 in the Bronx; and 106 and 107 in Manhattan.

        An analysis of both the rate of drop-off sites per capita and the community districts where the service has been restored so far shows that six of the 7 CDs belong to the top 25 community districts that have the highest drop-off sites per capita.

        Conversely, community districts 503 (Staten Island), 318 (Brooklyn), 305 (Brooklyn), and 404 (Queens) aren’t eligible for curbside composting and belong to the top 10 community districts that have the lowest drop-off sites per capita. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Critics of the curbside composting program argue that it is too expensive. A <a href="https://ibo.nyc.ny.us/iboreports/going-green-can-the-organics-collection-program-be%20fiscally-and-environmentally-sustainable-fiscal-brief-october-2021.pdf">study</a>  published in October by the NYC Independent Budget Office showed that collecting and processing organic waste is more than three times as expensive as collecting and processing refuse or recycling. However, the same study specified that the fastest route to improve the viability of the program is to increase the number of residents who use it. This would reduce the cost of the service per ton.
